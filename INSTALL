Installing
==========

a2web depends on libxmlrpc-c and libfcgi. We recommend aria2 >= 1.14.0.

With these installed, compile with the usual "make".



FastCGI is backwards compatible with CGI, so you can run a2web under
most http servers. We have tested busybox httpd, lighttpd and apache.

If you want to set up passworded access to a2web, that belongs to your
web server configuration.

If you need better access times, you can configure FastCGI; if not,
regular CGI uses less RAM.

xmlrpc-c should be able to use any of the client backends, but only curl
has been tested.



Since a2web is a CGI app, there is no "make install" target. Copy
a2web.cgi to your cgi-bin directory, and one or more themes to your
www space.



Configuration
=============

a2web ships with a sample config file. a2web.conf must be in the same
directory as a2web.cgi is.  There you can configure the RPC user and
password if set up in aria2, where the theme is found, and where the
aria2 instance is set up.
